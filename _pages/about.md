<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I am currently a Phd student at Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by <a href="https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/#">Prof. Jiannong Cao</a>. I got double bachelor‚Äôs degree in September 2018 from the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Computing, Shenzhen University. After that, I obtained my master's degree in September 2019 from the School of Design, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

My research interest broadly lies in advanced reinforcemen learning theory and algorithms on decision making as well as their promising applications on autonomous vehicles and robotics. Specifically, I pay much attention to bridging the complex and intractable sim-to-real gaps that potentially deteriorate RL policies, seeking more practical solutions for real-world deployment.
