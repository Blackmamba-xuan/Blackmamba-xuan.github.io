<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I am currently a phd student at Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by <a href="https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/#">Prof. Jiannong Cao</a>. I got double bachelor’s degree in September 2018 from the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Computing, Shenzhen University. After that, I obtained my master's degree in September 2019 from the School of Design, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

My research interest broadly lies in advanced reinforcemen learning theory and algorithms on decision making as well as their promising applications on autonomous vehicles and robotics. However, over recent years, criticism against RL continues to pour regarding its limited real-world applicability. Specifically, I therefore pay much attention to bridging the complex and intractable sim-to-real gaps that potentially deteriorate RL policies, seeking more practical solutions for real-world deployment.
